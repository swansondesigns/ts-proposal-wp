# Ongoing Costs

## Understanding Long-Term Investment

While WordPress itself is free, there are some ongoing costs associated with maintaining a professional website. We believe in complete transparency about these costs so you can budget appropriately.

### Optional Hosting Services

We offer comprehensive hosting services at **$50/month** that include:

- High-performance server infrastructure
- Daily automated backups (on-site and off-site)
- Regular security updates
- Plugin and theme updates
- Uptime monitoring
- Basic troubleshooting
- Disaster recovery services
- SSL certificate management

**Important**: You are not required to host with us. You're free to choose any hosting provider that meets your needs. We provide hosting as a convenience for clients who prefer a single point of contact for their website needs.

### Third-Party Plugin Licenses

Modern websites often benefit from specialized plugins that add advanced functionality. These are developed by independent companies and may have annual license fees:

- Typical costs range from $30-100 per plugin per year
- Licenses usually include updates and support
- Initial purchase price is included in the project cost
- Renewal is optional but recommended for critical features
- We'll discuss each plugin with you before purchase

Examples might include:
- Advanced form builders
- SEO optimization tools
- Security enhancements
- Performance optimization plugins
- Specialized content management tools

### Domain Registration

Your domain name (yourwebsite.com) requires annual renewal:

- Typically $15-20 per year for .com domains
- Can be managed through any registrar
- We can assist with renewal if needed

### SSL Certificate

All websites need SSL certificates for security:

- Free options are available (Let's Encrypt)
- Paid certificates range from $50-200/year
- Included with our hosting service
- Required for secure data transmission

### Optional Maintenance Services

Beyond hosting, you may want additional support:

- Content updates and changes
- Feature additions
- Design updates
- Performance optimization
- Security audits
- Regular reporting

These services are billed at our standard hourly rate of $125/hour or can be arranged through a maintenance agreement.

### Cost-Saving Considerations

WordPress helps minimize ongoing costs:

- No platform licensing fees
- No per-user charges
- No transaction fees
- No mandatory subscriptions
- Own your code and content
- Freedom to change providers

### Budget Planning

Typical annual costs for most organizations:

- **Hosting**: $600 (if using our services)
- **Domain**: $20
- **Plugin renewals**: $100-300 (varies by needs)
- **SSL**: $0-100 (free with our hosting)
- **Maintenance**: As needed

**Total**: Most clients budget $750-1,200 annually for ongoing costs, plus any additional development or maintenance work.
