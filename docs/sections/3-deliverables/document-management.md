# Document Management

## SEC Compliance and Document Management Solution

For Tri-State's SEC compliance and proof of posting requirements, we recommend implementing a third-party service specifically designed for regulatory document management.

### SEC Compliance - Proof of Posting Solution

The regulatory requirement for verifiable posting timestamps and compliance documentation will be met through a specialized third-party platform that provides:

-   **Automated timestamp documentation** with legally defensible posting records
-   **Version control and historical tracking** of all document updates
-   **Compliance reporting capabilities** for regulatory submissions
-   **Audit trail functionality** that meets SEC requirements
-   **Integration capabilities** with your website for seamless document publishing

### Implementation Approach

We will:

-   Research and recommend platforms that specialize in SEC compliance and regulatory document management
-   Provide guidance on platform selection based on your specific regulatory requirements
-   Assist with initial setup and configuration to meet compliance standards
-   Create integration points between the website and the chosen compliance platform

This approach ensures you have professional-grade regulatory compliance capabilities with the legal backing and specialized features that purpose-built platforms provide, rather than attempting to create custom compliance solutions.
