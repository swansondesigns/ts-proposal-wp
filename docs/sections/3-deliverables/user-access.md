# User Access

## User Role and Access Management System

We'll implement a comprehensive user access system that provides appropriate permissions for different types of users while maintaining security.

### Employee Role Configuration

Custom user roles will be configured to match Tri-State's organizational needs:

-   **Content Editor Role** - Full access to create, edit, and publish all content types (posts, pages, media)
-   **Blog Editor Role** - Limited access to blog posts and news articles only, with no access to pages or site settings
-   **Site Administrator Role** - Complete access to all website functions and administrative settings

Each role includes appropriate workflow capabilities such as draft saving, content scheduling, and version control through WordPress's built-in systems.

### Temporary External User System

A system for managing temporary external user access will be implemented:

-   **Access request form** for external users to submit access requests
-   **Administrative approval workflow** allowing Tri-State staff to review and approve requests
-   **Protected page system** where specific pages can be password-protected or restricted to logged-in users
-   **Temporary account creation** with limited permissions for approved external users
-   **Account management tools** for administrators to control and monitor temporary access

### Security Implementation

Basic security measures will be included:

-   User role restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions
-   Protected content areas that require authentication
-   Clear user identification to distinguish between internal staff and temporary external users

### Private File Designation

We will implement the **Prevent Direct Access (PDA)** plugin to secure uploaded files and documents:

-   **One-Click Media Protection** - Secure files directly from the WordPress Media Library with simple interface controls
-   **Prevent Search Engines and AI Indexers** - Prevents search engines and AI indexers from accessing and indexing protected files
-   **Role-Based Permissions** - File authors and administrators maintain access while blocking everyone else

This feature mirrors the private file manager from the current website solution.
