## Professional Form Management System

We'll implement a comprehensive form management system that gives Tri-State staff complete flexibility to create and modify forms independently while ensuring reliable delivery and professional presentation. This solution provides enterprise-level form capabilities without requiring technical expertise.

-   **Complete field library** - Text, email, phone, dropdown menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, and date pickers
-   **Field customization** - Update labels, help text, placeholder text, and validation rules without coding
-   **Multi-page capabilities** - Create step-by-step forms with progress indicators for better user experience
-   **Conditional logic** - Show or hide fields based on previous selections to create dynamic, personalized forms

### Administrative Features

**Form Management Dashboard** Staff will have access to a centralized dashboard for:

-   **Form scheduling** - Set automatic open and close dates for time-sensitive forms

-   **Entry management** - View, filter, search, and export form submissions

### User Experience Optimization

### Email Delivery Integration

**Professional Email Service** To ensure reliable form notifications, we'll integrate with a professional email delivery service such as:

-   **Automated notifications** - Immediate alerts to staff when forms are submitted
-   **Custom email templates** - Professional-looking notifications with Tri-State branding
-   **Delivery tracking** - Confirmation that emails were successfully delivered
-   **Spam prevention** - Professional sender reputation that keeps emails out of spam folders

### Confirmation and Follow-up

**Submission Management** Each form will include:

-   **Custom thank-you pages** - Branded confirmation pages with relevant next steps
