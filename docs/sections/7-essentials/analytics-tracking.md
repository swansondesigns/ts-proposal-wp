# Analytics & Tracking

## Google Tag Manager Integration

We'll integrate Google Tag Manager into the Tri-State website to enable comprehensive analytics and tracking capabilities. Understanding how your website is used is critical for both improving user experience and demonstrating value to stakeholders.

### GTM Container Implementation

The website will include:

-   **Google Tag Manager container** properly installed across all pages
-   **Correct placement** in both header and body sections for optimal functionality
-   **Full GTM support** for custom event tracking and conversion tracking
-   **Testing verification** to ensure the container loads correctly on all pages
-   **Tracking consistency** maintained across the entire website
-   **Future flexibility** for additional tracking codes as needed

This provides the foundation for Tri-State to configure their own tracking, analytics, and marketing pixels through the Google Tag Manager interface without requiring additional website changes. Your team can manage most analytics needs independently through the GTM dashboard.

### Key Capabilities Enabled

With Google Tag Manager properly implemented, Tri-State will be able to:

-   Track visitor behavior and website usage patterns
-   Monitor conversion events for key actions (form submissions, downloads, etc.)
-   Implement marketing and advertising pixels
-   Set up custom analytics for specific campaigns or initiatives
-   Add new tracking without developer assistance
