# User Management

## Managing Who Can Access Your Website

WordPress includes a complete system for managing users who need to access the administrative side of your website. This built-in functionality handles the basics of user accounts and access control.

### User Accounts

WordPress sites can have unlimited users, each with their own username and password. Administrators can create new user accounts when team members join, and remove accounts when they leave. Each user has their own profile where they can manage their password and contact information.

### Password Security

WordPress handles password security automatically. When users forget their passwords, they can request a reset link via email. The system enforces password strength requirements and handles the secure storage of login credentials.

### Access Control

Not everyone needs access to everything. WordPress lets you control what features and areas each user can access. This serves two important purposes:

**Security** - By limiting access to only what each person needs, you reduce the risk of accidental changes or security issues. For example, someone who only writes blog posts doesn't need access to change website settings.

**Usability** - When users log in, they only see the tools and options relevant to their role. This makes the system less overwhelming and easier to use. A content writer sees writing tools, while a site administrator sees everything.

### User Activity

WordPress keeps track of who creates and modifies content. Every page, blog post, and media file shows who uploaded it and when. This creates accountability and helps you understand who's responsible for different parts of your website.
