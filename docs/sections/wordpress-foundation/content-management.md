# Core Content Management

## What WordPress Provides for Managing Your Content

WordPress comes with a comprehensive set of tools for creating, organizing, and managing your website content. Understanding these built-in features helps clarify what's already included versus what requires custom development.

### Pages and Collections

WordPress organizes content in two fundamental ways:

#### Pages

Pages are for standalone content that doesn't change often and isn't tied to a specific date. Think of your About Us page, your Services page, or your Contact page. These are the backbone of your website structure.

Pages can be organized like folders on your computer. You can have main pages with sub-pages underneath them. For example, you might have a main "Services" page with individual service pages nested below it. This creates logical website addresses like yoursite.com/services/consulting.

#### Collections

Collections are groups of similar items that share common characteristics. WordPress comes with one built-in collection called "Blog" for articles and news updates. But collections can be created for any type of content you need to organize - team members, projects, testimonials, events, or products.

There are two ways collections are typically used:

**Visitable Collections** - These create their own webpages that visitors can view directly. Each blog post, for example, has its own webpage with its own web address. A visitor can read the full article by clicking through to it.

**Component Collections** - These store content that gets displayed as part of other webpages, but don't create standalone webpages themselves. For instance, you might have a collection of team member profiles that appear on your About page, or testimonials that display throughout your site. The information is stored in an organized way, but visitors don't navigate to individual testimonial pages - they see them integrated into your other content.

All collections can be organized using categories (like sections in a newspaper) and tags (like keywords that describe the content). WordPress automatically keeps collections organized by date as well, with the newest items appearing first when you view them in the admin area.

### The Content Editor

WordPress provides a visual editor that works much like familiar word processing software. You can format text, add images, embed videos, and create layouts without needing to know any code. The editor saves your work automatically as you type, and keeps a history of all changes so you can restore earlier versions if needed.

The editor uses a modern approach where content is organized in blocks - a paragraph is a block, an image is a block, a heading is a block. This makes it easy to rearrange content by moving blocks around, similar to rearranging slides in a presentation.

### Managing Images and Files

The Media Library is WordPress's filing system for all your images, documents, and other files. When you upload an image, WordPress automatically creates several sizes - thumbnail, medium, large, and full size. This means your website can display the right size image for different situations, keeping pages loading quickly.

You can upload files by dragging them directly into WordPress, and the system organizes them by date. Finding files later is simple with built-in search and filtering tools. Basic image editing is included too - you can crop images, rotate them, or flip them without needing separate software.

### Navigation Menus

Your website's navigation menus help visitors find their way around. WordPress lets you create different menus for different areas of your site - typically a main menu in the header, maybe a footer menu with important links, and sometimes sidebar menus for specific sections.

Creating and organizing menus is straightforward. You simply choose which pages, collection items, or custom links to include, then drag them into the order you want. You can create dropdown menus by dragging items slightly to the right to nest them under other items.

### Search Functionality

Every WordPress site includes basic search functionality. Visitors can search for content, and WordPress will look through all your pages and collection items to find matches. The search results appear on a dedicated results page that's automatically created and styled to match your site.

### Foundation for Search Engines

WordPress is built with search engines in mind. It creates clean, readable web addresses for all your content (like yoursite.com/about instead of yoursite.com/?page=123). It also generates the technical files that help search engines understand and index your site's content.

The HTML code that WordPress produces follows modern web standards, making it easier for search engines to understand your content structure and importance.
