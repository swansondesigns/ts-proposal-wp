# Content Management

## Organizing Content in Wordpress

WordPress comes with a **comprehensive set of tools for creating**, organizing, and managing your website content. Understanding these built-in features helps clarify what's already included versus what requires custom development.

### Pages

Pages are for standalone content that doesn't change often and isn't tied to a specific date, such as your _About Us_ page, your _Services_ page, or your _Contact_ page. **These are the backbone of your website structure**.

Pages can be organized hierarchically with main pages and sub-pages underneath them, creating a logical structure for your website content.

### Collections

Collections are groups of similar items that share common characteristics. WordPress includes a built-in collection called “Blog” for articles and news updates, but you can create collections for any type of content you need to organize, such as team members, projects, testimonials, events, or products.

There are two ways collections are typically used:

-   **Visitable Collections** - These create their own webpages that visitors can view directly. Each blog post, for example, has its own webpage with its own web address. A visitor can read the full article by clicking through to it.

-   **Component Collections** - These store content that gets displayed as part of other webpages, but don't create standalone webpages themselves. For instance, you might have a collection of team member profiles that appear on your About page, or testimonials that display throughout your site. The information is stored in an organized way, but visitors don't navigate to individual testimonial pages - they see them integrated into your other content.

### Tagging and categories

All collections can be organized using categories (like sections in a newspaper) and tags (like keywords that describe the content). WordPress automatically keeps collections organized by date as well, with the newest items appearing first when you view them in the admin area.

### The Content Editor

WordPress includes a basic text editor similar to older versions of Microsoft Word. It has basic formatting tools - bold, italic, headings, bullet points, and the ability to add images or links. Content is edited in one large text box, and what you see while editing doesn't always match how it appears on your website.

While we include this description for completeness, modern websites do not use this feature much. A description of what we will use instead is in the Development and Deliverables section below.

### Managing Images and Files

The Media Library is the WordPress system for managing all images, documents and files. Images are optimized for the web without additional steps. All meta data is easily visible/editable and the search feature is fast and easy. Thumbnails make it easy to identify which asset you are looking for.

### Navigation Menus

WordPress makes it easy to create and organize your website's navigation without any technical expertise. The system uses a simple drag-and-drop interface - you can arrange your menu items by dragging them into the order you want and create dropdown menus by nesting items under others. It’s fast, simple and intuitive.

### Search Functionality

Every WordPress site includes basic search functionality. Visitors can search for content, and WordPress will look through all your pages and collection items to find matches. The search results appear on a dedicated results page that's automatically created and styled to match your site.

### Foundation for Search Engines

WordPress automatically generates search-engine-friendly web addresses based on your site structure. When pages are organized in parent/child relationships, it creates logical paths that help both visitors and search engines understand your site. For example, a main “Services” page with a “Consulting” sub-page becomes <u>example.com/services/consulting</u>. This hierarchical structure clarifies content relationships and improves overall site organization.

_This foundation of features comes standard with WordPress. In the Custom Development section, we'll explain how we build upon these capabilities to create the specific features and functionality your website needs._
