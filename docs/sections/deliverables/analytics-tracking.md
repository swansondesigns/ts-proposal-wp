# Analytics & Tracking

## Google Tag Manager Integration

We'll integrate Google Tag Manager into the Tri-State website to enable analytics and tracking capabilities.

### GTM Container Implementation

The website will include:

-   Google Tag Manager container properly installed across all pages
-   Correct placement in both header and body sections
-   Testing to verify the container loads correctly

This provides the foundation for Tri-State to configure their own tracking, analytics, and marketing pixels through the Google Tag Manager interface without requiring additional website changes.

## Questions

**Additional Analytics Requirements**: Are there any other analytics, tracking, or measurement tools that need to be integrated into the website?
