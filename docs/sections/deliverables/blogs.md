# Blogs

## Multiple Content Collections

We'll create distinct collections for each type of content you publish:

- **Blog** - Your main thought leadership platform
- **News** - Formal press releases and announcements
- **Features** - In-depth articles and special content
- **Resources** - Educational materials and guides
- **Newsletter Archive** - Historical email campaigns

Each collection will have its own identity and presentation while maintaining overall site consistency. Visitors will be able to browse each collection independently, and you'll be able to cross-reference content between collections.

### Implementation Approach

Each publication channel will be implemented using WordPress's taxonomy system, allowing you to:

- Maintain separate archive pages for each channel
- Apply different layouts and styling per channel
- Create channel-specific RSS feeds
- Filter and sort within each channel
- Cross-reference content between channels when relevant

### Content Management

The marketing team will be able to:

- Easily assign content to the appropriate channel
- Manage categories and tags within each channel
- Set featured content for each channel
- Control the display order and prominence of content
- Archive or retire old content while maintaining URLs
