# Custom Features

## Flexible Content System

We'll build a sophisticated content management system that goes far beyond basic WordPress capabilities, giving you powerful tools to create and manage your content.

### Content Block System

Instead of being limited to basic text editing, you'll have access to a library of custom-designed content blocks. Each block serves a specific purpose and can be combined in countless ways to create unique pages.

#### Block Variations and Customization

What makes this system particularly powerful is how each block can be customized. Think of it this way:

Each content block comes with **variations** - different layouts for the same type of content. For example, a testimonial block might have:
- A simple centered quote
- A card layout with photo
- A full-width design with background image

Each variation can then be **customized** with your brand's color palettes. If you have four color schemes and three layout variations, that single testimonial block actually gives you twelve different presentation options.

This multiplication effect happens across all your content blocks. A call-to-action block with three layouts and four color schemes provides twelve options. A content section with four layouts and four color palettes gives you sixteen possibilities. 

The result? Hundreds of unique combinations from a manageable set of building blocks, ensuring your pages can be diverse and engaging while maintaining brand consistency.

### Special Content Solutions

Sometimes you need something unique - a special layout for an annual report, a custom presentation for a campaign, or a one-off design for a special event. We understand that not everything fits into standard templates.

For these situations, we'll provide a flexible solution that allows custom content to be created and inserted exactly where you need it. Think of it as having a "custom content" block that can hold anything - from a specially designed infographic to an interactive timeline to a unique layout that will only be used once.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the efficiency and consistency of a structured block system for your everyday needs, plus the flexibility to create completely custom content when the situation demands it.

### Multiple Content Collections

We'll create distinct collections for each type of content you publish:

- **Blog** - Your main thought leadership platform
- **News** - Formal press releases and announcements
- **Features** - In-depth articles and special content
- **Resources** - Educational materials and guides
- **Newsletter Archive** - Historical email campaigns
- **Podcast** - Your Western Watts podcast with full episode management

Each collection will have its own identity and presentation while maintaining overall site consistency. Visitors will be able to browse each collection independently, and you'll be able to cross-reference content between collections.

Your content management system will include:

- Visual page builder for drag-and-drop simplicity
- Preview capabilities to see changes before publishing
