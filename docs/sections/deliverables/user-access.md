# User Access

## User Role and Access Management System

We'll implement a comprehensive user access system that provides appropriate permissions for different types of users while maintaining security.

### Employee Role Configuration

Custom user roles will be configured to match Tri-State's organizational needs:

-   **Content Editor Role** - Full access to create, edit, and publish all content types (posts, pages, media)
-   **Blog Editor Role** - Limited access to blog posts and news articles only, with no access to pages or site settings
-   **Site Administrator Role** - Complete access to all website functions and administrative settings

Each role includes appropriate workflow capabilities such as draft saving, content scheduling, and version control through WordPress's built-in systems.

### Temporary External User System

A system for managing temporary external user access will be implemented:

-   **Access request form** for external users to submit access requests
-   **Administrative approval workflow** allowing Tri-State staff to review and approve requests
-   **Protected page system** where specific pages can be password-protected or restricted to logged-in users
-   **Temporary account creation** with limited permissions for approved external users
-   **Account management tools** for administrators to control and monitor temporary access

### Security Implementation

Basic security measures will be included:

-   User role restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to administrative functions
-   Protected content areas that require authentication
-   Clear user identification to distinguish between internal staff and temporary external users

## Questions

**Account Expiration**: Should temporary external accounts automatically expire after a set period, or would you prefer manual account management?

**Form Management Role**: Would you like a dedicated user role specifically for form management with access only to form creation and submission viewing?
