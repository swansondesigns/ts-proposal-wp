# Full Development Freedom

## Professional Codebase Management

All custom development work for the Tri-State website will be stored securely in multiple locations to ensure complete protection and accessibility, giving you full ownership and control.

### Codebase Repository Management

Your website's custom development will be maintained in a professional version control system with:

-   **Primary repository** hosted on GitHub with complete project history
-   **Local development backups** maintained on developer workstations
-   **Hosting platform backup** through WP Engine's integrated Git functionality
-   **Complete change tracking** with detailed commit messages for all modifications

### Change Documentation

All development changes will be properly documented and tracked:

-   Every modification includes a clear description of what was changed and why
-   Version history maintains a complete record of all updates and enhancements
-   Code comments explain complex functionality for future reference
-   Major feature additions are documented with implementation notes

This multi-layered approach ensures that your website's custom development is never at risk of being lost and that all changes are traceable and well-documented for ongoing maintenance and future development.
