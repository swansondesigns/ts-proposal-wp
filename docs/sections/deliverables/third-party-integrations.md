# Third Party Integrations

## Salesforce Integration Solution

We will implement integration between the Tri-State website and Salesforce to ensure seamless data flow between systems.

### Integration Approach

The specific integration approach will be determined based on your requirements, but options include:

- **Direct API Integration** - Real-time data synchronization using Salesforce APIs
- **Form Integration** - Web-to-lead or web-to-case form submissions
- **Middleware Solution** - Using tools like Zapier for flexible connections
- **Custom Integration** - Purpose-built connectors for specific needs

### Implementation Details

*The specific implementation will be determined during discovery based on:*

- Data flow requirements
- Security considerations
- Volume of data transfer
- Real-time vs. batch processing needs
- Budget constraints

### Data Security

All integrations will be implemented with security best practices:

- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure API credentials management
- Audit logging of data transfers
- Error handling and recovery
- Compliance with both systems' security requirements

### Support and Maintenance

Once implemented, the integration will include:

- Documentation of the integration architecture
- Testing procedures
- Error monitoring
- Update procedures when either system changes

*Final integration specifications will be developed during the project discovery phase.*
