# Hosting

## Infrastructure Requirements

Tri-State requires professional hosting infrastructure that provides reliability, security, and support appropriate for a corporate website.

### Development and Testing Environments

Beyond the live website, Tri-State needs separate environments for testing changes before they go live. This prevents mistakes on the production site and allows for proper review and approval processes.

_Note: These environments are used for reviewing code changes, new features, and software updates - not for content review or approval workflows._

### Backup and Recovery

The hosting solution must include comprehensive backup systems with:

-   Automated daily backups for continuous protection
-   Ability to create custom backups by either the developer or Tri-State staff
-   Restore capabilities available to both the developer and Tri-State staff
-   Complete site management tools and administrative access
-   Quick recovery processes that minimize downtime

### Security

Tri-State requires enterprise-level security including protection against attacks, regular security updates, SSL certificates for secure connections, and monitoring for potential threats.

### Performance and Reliability

The website must load quickly for visitors across the country, handle traffic spikes during important announcements, and maintain high availability with minimal downtime.

### Professional Support

Both the development team and Tri-State staff need access to knowledgeable support when issues arise. The hosting provider should offer WordPress expertise, not just general server support. Professional support should be easily accessible to both parties when assistance is needed.
