# Document Management

## Regulatory and Document Requirements

Your organization has specific requirements for document management driven by regulatory compliance and stakeholder communication needs.

### SEC Compliance - Proof of Posting

As a regulated entity, you must comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for timely posting of certain documents. Your requirements include:

- **Verifiable Posting** - A system that proves when documents were posted to your website
- **Timestamp Documentation** - Clear, auditable records of publication dates and times
- **Version Control** - Tracking document updates and maintaining historical versions
- **Compliance Reporting** - The ability to generate reports demonstrating compliance with posting requirements

Currently, you have no reliable way to prove that you've met these regulatory requirements. You need a system that creates an indisputable record of when materials were made publicly available.

### Document Categories

Your website must handle various types of documents, each with different requirements:

**Public Documents**
- Annual reports
- Quarterly earnings
- Press releases  
- Corporate governance documents
- Public filings

**Restricted Documents**
- Board materials
- Internal reports
- Confidential presentations
- Draft documents pending approval

**Time-Sensitive Documents**
- Earnings releases that must go live at specific times
- Regulatory filings with strict deadlines
- Embargoed materials

### Document Organization

Documents need to be organized in ways that make sense to different audiences:

- By document type (reports, presentations, filings)
- By date or reporting period
- By category or department
- By access level

Visitors should be able to quickly find the documents they need without confusion.

### Audit Trail Requirements

For compliance purposes, you need comprehensive tracking:

- Who uploaded each document
- When documents were posted or modified
- Who approved documents for publication
- Download activity for sensitive documents
- Any changes to document access levels

### Integration with Existing Workflows

The document management system needs to work with your existing processes:

- Documents prepared in standard office formats
- Review and approval processes
- Email notifications for new postings
- Integration with your compliance calendar

### Search and Discovery

Users need to be able to find documents quickly:

- Search by document title or content
- Filter by date ranges
- Browse by category
- Sort by relevance or date
- Access from multiple entry points on the site
