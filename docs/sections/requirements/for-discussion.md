# For Discussion

## Items Requiring Client Input and Clarification

This document outlines features and functionality that need discussion and clarification during our meeting. These items will help shape the final scope and ensure we're building exactly what Tri-State needs.

### Search Functionality

The current Tri-State website has a search feature, though we understand it may not be meeting your needs effectively. We need to discuss whether search is a required feature for the new site and, if so, what it should accomplish.

If search is needed, we should explore what visitors are typically searching for. Are they looking for specific documents like annual reports or SEC filings? Are they searching for news articles about particular topics? Or are they trying to find contact information or specific services? Understanding the actual use cases will help us determine whether a robust search system is worth the investment or if better navigation and content organization might solve the problem more effectively.

For site-wide search, we could implement a system that searches across all content types including pages, documents, blog posts, and resources. This would include intelligent result ranking, search suggestions as users type, and clear labeling of what type of content each result represents. Users would be able to filter and refine their results after searching.

Different sections of your site might benefit from specialized search capabilities. The document library could have its own search that allows filtering by document type, date range, or category. Your various publication channels (Blog, News, Resources, Podcast) might need search functions within those specific content areas. The podcast section, for instance, could potentially include transcript search if that level of functionality is valuable.

Beyond traditional search, we should discuss how visitors currently navigate and discover content. Would features like related content suggestions, topic-based browsing, chronological archives, or "Most Popular" content lists be more valuable than search? Sometimes improving the navigation structure and content organization eliminates the need for search entirely.

If we do implement search, we could enhance WordPress's basic search with features like relevant results ranking, filtering and sorting options, search suggestions as users type, helpful alternatives when no results are found, and administrative search tools for finding content quickly in the backend.

### Content Reusability

Efficiency in content management often comes from being able to reuse content across multiple pages. We should discuss whether you need the ability to create content once and use it in multiple places.

For example, testimonials might appear on your homepage, service pages, and a dedicated testimonials page. Team member information could be displayed on an About page, in blog post bylines, and in contact sections. Legal disclaimers and compliance text might need to appear consistently across multiple pages.

If content reusability is important, we can build systems that allow you to update information in one place and have it automatically update everywhere it appears. This reduces maintenance work and ensures consistency. However, if most of your content is unique to each page, this feature might add unnecessary complexity.

### Content Migration

The existing Tri-State website contains a significant amount of content that may need to be moved to the new site. We need to discuss the scope and approach for content migration.

Content migration can range from a complete transfer of all existing content to a selective migration of only current, relevant materials. Some organizations use a website redesign as an opportunity to audit and clean up their content, migrating only what's still valuable and leaving outdated information behind.

We should discuss what content needs to be migrated, including pages, blog posts, news articles, documents, and media files. If migration is needed, we'll need to determine who is responsible for the migration work. Will your team handle copying content to the new site, or should we include migration services in the project scope? 

The complexity and cost of migration depends on the volume of content and how it needs to be reorganized. Straight transfers are simpler than migrations that require reformatting or restructuring content for new layouts.

### Workflow and Publishing Features

There are several workflow and publishing capabilities we should discuss to determine if they would be valuable for your team:

**Preview Capabilities** - The ability to see changes before publishing them live. This could include preview links that can be shared with stakeholders for approval before content goes public.

**Revision History** - WordPress includes basic revision tracking, but we could enhance this to provide more detailed history of changes, who made them, and the ability to compare or restore previous versions.

**Scheduled Publishing** - For time-sensitive content like earnings releases or regulatory filings, the ability to prepare content in advance and have it automatically publish at a specific date and time.

**Draft and Review Workflows** - If multiple people are involved in content creation and approval, we could implement formal workflows where content moves through draft, review, and approval stages before publication.

**Content Duplication** - The ability to duplicate existing pages or posts as a starting point for new content, which can significantly speed up content creation when you have similar pages to create.

These features can add efficiency to your content management process, but they also add complexity. We should discuss which, if any, would provide real value to your team's workflow.
