# User Access

## Employee Access Management

Tri-State needs a system that allows multiple employees to make website updates without requiring full administrator privileges for everyone.

### Role-Based Access Control

Different employees need different levels of access to website functions:

-   **Content Editors** - Can create, edit, and publish blog posts, news, and general content
-   **Blog Editors** - Limited to blog posts and news articles only (no access to pages or other content types)
-   **Site Administrators** - Full access to all website functions and settings

### Content Workflow

The system should support content management workflows:

-   Draft content that can be saved and revised before publishing
-   Ability to schedule content for future publication
-   Content review and approval processes when needed
-   Version control to track changes and revert if necessary

## Temporary External User Access

Tri-State occasionally needs to provide limited website access to approved external parties such as contractors, consultants, or business partners.

### Access Request Process

External users can request access through a formal process:

-   Online application form for access requests
-   Internal approval workflow for Tri-State staff to review requests
-   Ability to specify which protected pages or sections the user needs access to
-   Documentation of the business purpose for the access request

### Temporary Account Management

Once approved, temporary accounts provide controlled access:

-   Access restricted to specific password-protected pages or sections
-   No ability to make changes to website content or settings
-   Clear identification that the user has temporary/external status

## Questions

**Automatic Account Expiration**: Would you like temporary accounts to automatically expire after a set period (30 days, 60 days, etc.) or would you prefer to manually manage account access on a case-by-case basis?

**Form Management Role**: Would you like a dedicated user role for form management that provides access only to create, modify, and view form submissions without access to other website content or settings?
