# User Access & Security

## Controlled Access Requirements

Your organization has specific needs around controlling who can access certain content on your website, both for internal team members and external stakeholders.

### Temporary Limited Access for External Users

You need a system that allows members of the public to request temporary access to specific protected content. This requirement includes:

- A registration process where external users can request access
- Approval workflow for granting access to specific pages or sections
- Time-limited access that automatically expires
- Clear distinction between public content and protected content
- Audit trail of who accessed what and when

This is particularly important for investor relations materials, regulatory filings, and other sensitive documents that need controlled distribution.

### Protected Document Storage

Not all documents on your website should be publicly accessible. You require a secure document management system where:

- Documents can be uploaded and stored securely
- Direct URL access to documents can be restricted
- Only authenticated and authorized users can download protected files
- The system prevents unauthorized sharing of document links
- Different documents can have different access levels

Simply knowing or guessing a document's web address should not grant access to it. This is critical for confidential materials, financial documents, and other sensitive information.

### Internal User Management

Your team members need varying levels of access to the website's administrative functions:

- Content creators who can draft and edit content
- Reviewers who can approve content for publication  
- Administrators who can manage users and settings
- Department-specific access for relevant content areas

### Security Compliance

Your industry requires adherence to security best practices:

- Strong password requirements
- Regular security updates
- Activity logging for audit purposes
- Secure data transmission
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

### Access Reporting

You need visibility into how protected content is being accessed:

- Who is accessing protected content
- When access occurred
- What content was accessed
- Failed access attempts
- User activity patterns

This reporting is essential for both security monitoring and regulatory compliance.
