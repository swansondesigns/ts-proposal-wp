# Search & Discovery

## Helping Visitors Find What They Need

Your website must make it easy for different audiences to find specific content quickly and efficiently.

### Site-Wide Search

Visitors need robust search capabilities that go beyond basic keyword matching:

- Search across all content types (pages, documents, blog posts, resources)
- Intelligent results that understand context and relevance
- Search suggestions as users type
- Clear indication of what type of content each result represents
- Filtering options to narrow results

### Content-Specific Search

Different sections of your site need specialized search capabilities:

- **Document Library** - Search by document type, date range, or category
- **Blog/News** - Search within specific publication channels
- **Resources** - Filter by topic, format, or audience
- **Podcast** - Search episodes by topic, guest, or transcript content

### Navigation and Discovery

Beyond search, visitors need multiple ways to discover content:

- Related content suggestions
- Topic-based browsing
- Chronological archives
- Category and tag filtering
- "Most Popular" or "Most Recent" content lists

### SEO Requirements

Your content needs to be discoverable through search engines:

- Optimized page titles and descriptions
- Structured data for rich search results
- Clean URLs that describe content
- Proper content hierarchy
- Mobile-friendly pages that meet search engine requirements

### Internal Linking

Content should be interconnected to help visitors explore related topics:

- Automatic related content suggestions
- Cross-references between related materials
- Clear pathways between connected content areas
- Breadcrumb navigation showing content hierarchy

### Analytics Integration

You need to understand how visitors find and use your content:

- What search terms visitors use
- Which content is most frequently accessed
- How visitors navigate through your site
- Where visitors struggle to find information
- Which search queries return no results

This information helps you continuously improve content organization and discoverability.
