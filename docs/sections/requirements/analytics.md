# Analytics & Reporting

## Tracking and Measurement Requirements

Understanding how your website is used is critical for both improving user experience and demonstrating value to stakeholders.

### Google Tag Manager Integration

Your organization uses Google Tag Manager as your primary analytics platform. The website must:

- Support full Google Tag Manager implementation
- Allow for custom event tracking
- Enable conversion tracking for key actions
- Maintain tracking consistency across all pages
- Support additional tracking codes as needed

### Performance Metrics

You need visibility into how your website performs:

- Page load speeds
- User engagement metrics
- Content performance
- Traffic sources and patterns
- User journey mapping

### Compliance Tracking

For regulatory purposes, you need specific tracking capabilities:

- Document download tracking
- Time-on-page for compliance materials
- User access logs for protected content
- Proof of publication timestamps
- Audit trails for content changes

### Content Analytics

Understanding content effectiveness is essential:

- Which content receives the most engagement
- How different audiences interact with content
- Content sharing and distribution patterns
- Blog and resource performance

### Custom Reporting

Standard analytics aren't always sufficient. You need:

- Custom reports for board presentations
- Compliance reports for regulators

- User activity reports for security monitoring
- Executive dashboards with key metrics

### Real-Time Monitoring

Some situations require immediate awareness:

- Website availability and uptime

### Data Privacy

All tracking must comply with privacy regulations:

- GDPR compliance where applicable
- Cookie consent management

Your analytics system needs to balance comprehensive tracking with respect for user privacy and regulatory compliance.
