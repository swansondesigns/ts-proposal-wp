# Forms

## Data Collection and User Interaction

Tri-State needs various forms throughout the website to collect information, process requests, and facilitate communication with different stakeholder groups.

### Contact Forms

The website requires multiple contact forms tailored to different purposes and departments. A general contact form for basic inquiries, departmental forms that route to specific teams, and a media contact form for press inquiries. Each form needs appropriate validation, clear error messaging, and confirmation that the submission was received.

### Application and Registration Forms

For events, programs, and services, Tri-State needs forms that can handle more complex data collection. This includes temporary user access request forms for protected content, event registration with capacity limits, program applications with file upload capabilities, and newsletter subscription management.

### Compliance and Regulatory Forms

Given Tri-State's regulatory requirements, certain forms need special handling. Document request forms that track who is requesting what information, complaint or concern submission forms that maintain proper records, and regulatory filing notifications that create audit trails.

### Form Management Requirements

The marketing team needs to be able to create and modify forms without developer assistance for routine needs. This includes adding or removing fields, updating field labels and help text, changing required field settings, and modifying confirmation messages and notifications.

### Data Handling and Security

All forms must handle data securely and appropriately. Submissions should be stored securely with appropriate retention policies, email notifications should go to the right people, sensitive data needs encryption, and spam protection must be effective without frustrating legitimate users.

### Integration Needs

Forms may need to integrate with other systems including email notification systems, CRM or database systems, Google Tag Manager for conversion tracking, and compliance tracking systems for regulatory forms.

### User Experience

Forms should be easy to complete with clear labels and helpful error messages, logical field order and grouping, mobile-friendly input methods, accessibility for users with disabilities, and progress indicators for multi-step forms when needed.

*Specific form requirements and integration needs will be finalized during the discovery phase of the project.*
