## Flexible Page Creation System

The marketing team needs the ability to create diverse page layouts without requiring developer assistance for every change.

### Flexible Page Building

The marketing team needs the ability to create diverse page layouts using a variety of content blocks and design elements. Pages throughout the Tri-State site will need different combinations of content types and layouts.

The key requirement is flexibility with consistency - the ability to create unique pages while maintaining your brand standards and design cohesion.

### One-Off and Special Content

Beyond standard page templates and content blocks, Tri-State occasionally needs to create unique content presentations for special initiatives, campaigns, or regulatory requirements. These one-off needs might include:

- Special landing pages for campaigns
- Unique layouts for annual reports
- Specialized content that doesn't fit standard templates

You need a system that provides structure for everyday content creation while remaining flexible enough to accommodate special requirements without compromising the integrity of the overall system.
