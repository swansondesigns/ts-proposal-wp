# Content & Publishing

## Your Content Management Needs

Your organization requires a sophisticated content management system that goes beyond basic blogging to handle multiple distinct content streams and publication types.

### Multiple Publication Channels

Your website needs to support several different publication channels, each with its own purpose and audience:

- **Blog** - Traditional blog posts for thought leadership and industry insights
- **News** - Press releases and company announcements requiring formal presentation
- **Features** - In-depth articles and special content pieces
- **Resources** - Educational materials and industry resources for your audience
- **Newsletter Archive** - Historical newsletters imported from your email marketing platform
- **Podcast** - Episodes of your Western Watts podcast with audio players and show notes

Each of these channels needs its own identity while maintaining consistency with your overall brand. Visitors should be able to browse each channel independently, subscribe to updates from specific channels, and easily understand what type of content they're viewing.

### Flexible Page Building

Your team needs the ability to create diverse page layouts without requiring developer assistance for every change. Pages throughout your site will need different combinations of:

- Hero sections with various layouts
- Content blocks with multiple column options
- Call-to-action sections
- Image galleries and carousels
- Team member displays
- Testimonial sections
- Document download areas
- Video embeds
- Interactive elements

The key requirement is flexibility with consistency - the ability to create unique pages while maintaining your brand standards and design cohesion.

### One-Off and Special Content

Beyond your standard page templates and content blocks, you occasionally need to create unique content presentations for special initiatives, campaigns, or regulatory requirements. These one-off needs might include:

- Special landing pages for campaigns
- Unique layouts for annual reports
- Custom presentations for investor materials
- Specialized content that doesn't fit standard templates

You need a system that provides structure for everyday content creation while remaining flexible enough to accommodate special requirements without compromising the integrity of the overall system.

### Content Reusability

Efficiency is important. Content created once should be reusable across multiple pages when appropriate. This includes:

- Testimonials that appear on multiple pages
- Team member information used in various contexts
- Disclaimers and legal text
- Common content blocks that appear site-wide

### Mobile-First Requirement

Every piece of content must work flawlessly on mobile devices. This isn't optional - mobile visitors must have the same quality experience as desktop users, with content that adapts intelligently to their screen size.
