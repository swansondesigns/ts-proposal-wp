# Hosting

## Infrastructure Requirements

Tri-State requires professional hosting infrastructure that provides reliability, security, and support appropriate for a corporate website.

### Development and Testing Environments

Beyond the live website, Tri-State needs separate environments for testing changes before they go live. This prevents mistakes on the production site and allows for proper review and approval processes.

### Backup and Recovery

The hosting solution must include comprehensive backup systems that protect against data loss, allow for quick recovery when needed, and provide peace of mind that the website can be restored if something goes wrong.

### Security

Tri-State requires enterprise-level security including protection against attacks, regular security updates, SSL certificates for secure connections, and monitoring for potential threats.

### Performance and Reliability

The website must load quickly for visitors across the country, handle traffic spikes during important announcements, and maintain high availability with minimal downtime.

### Professional Support

Both the development team and Tri-State staff need access to knowledgeable support when issues arise. The hosting provider should offer WordPress expertise, not just general server support.

### Compliance Standards

The hosting provider must meet appropriate compliance and security standards for a regulated utility company, including proper certifications and audit procedures.
