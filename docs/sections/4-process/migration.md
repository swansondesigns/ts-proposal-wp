# Migration Process

## Comprehensive Data Transition

Migrating from your current website to the new WordPress platform requires careful planning and execution to ensure no content is lost and everything functions properly in the new environment. Our extensive migration experience ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

## Content Migration Strategy

### Sequential Content Migration

Your current site contains four distinct types of time-based content that we'll migrate using automated scraping techniques:

- **Blogs** - Regular blog posts and articles
- **Features** - Feature stories and in-depth content
- **Resources** - Educational and reference materials  
- **News** - Press releases and news announcements

Each content type will be carefully extracted, cleaned, and imported into WordPress while preserving:
- Publication dates and chronological order
- Author information and bylines
- Categories and organizational structure
- Internal linking between related content
- SEO metadata and URL structures

### Media and Document Migration

**Image Processing**
All images from your current site will be:
- Downloaded and optimized for web performance
- Organized into WordPress media library with proper naming
- Linked correctly to their associated content
- Resized appropriately for responsive display
- Alt text preserved where available

**Document Management**  
PDF files, presentations, and other documents will be:
- Systematically catalogued and organized
- Uploaded to WordPress with consistent naming conventions
- Integrated with the new document management system
- Linked properly from relevant content pages
- Organized by type and date for easy administration

## Technical Migration Process

### Data Extraction and Cleaning

Using specialized scraping tools, we'll:
1. **Analyze current site structure** to identify all content types and relationships
2. **Extract content systematically** while maintaining data integrity
3. **Clean and format data** for optimal WordPress import
4. **Validate extracted content** to ensure completeness and accuracy
5. **Test import processes** in staging environment before final migration

### Content Mapping and Organization

Content will be reorganized to take advantage of WordPress's superior content management:
- Improved categorization and tagging systems
- Better search and filtering capabilities
- Enhanced content relationships and cross-references
- Streamlined navigation and user experience
- SEO-optimized URL structures

### Quality Assurance

Every migrated piece of content undergoes:
- **Formatting verification** - Ensuring proper display across devices
- **Link validation** - Confirming all internal and external links function
- **Media verification** - Testing image display and document accessibility
