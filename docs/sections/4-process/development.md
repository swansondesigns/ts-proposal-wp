# Development Process

## Transparent Project Management with Trello

We use Trello boards to manage every aspect of the Tri-State website development, providing complete transparency and streamlined communication throughout the project. This visual project management approach keeps everyone informed and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### Development Workflow Stages

Your project board is organized into clear stages that every feature and task moves through:

-   **Scratch Pad** - Initial ideas, notes, and features being planned or clarified
-   **To-Do** - Features ready to be developed with clear requirements
-   **Doing** - Features currently being actively worked on
-   **Ready for Review** - Completed work waiting for your feedback and approval
-   **Done** - Approved features completed and ready for launch

### Individual Feature Cards

Each feature, page, or development task gets its own Trello card with:

*[Image needed: Trello card showing comments, attachments, checklist, due dates]*
-   **Clear description** of what's being built
-   **Checklist** of technical requirements
-   **File attachments** for designs, screenshots, or documents
-   **Threaded comments** for all project communication
-   **Time stamps** showing progress and decision history

### Centralized Communication

Instead of scattered emails, all project communication happens in context:

-   **Single-topic discussions** - Each card focuses on one specific feature
-   **Team visibility** - Everyone can see relevant conversations
-   **Selective notifications** - Team members can watch specific cards or columns based on their role and interest
-   **File organization** - Screenshots and documents attached directly to relevant features
-   **No lost emails** - Everything stays organized in one place

### Client Benefits

**See Your Feedback Queue at a Glance** All items waiting for your input are clearly visible in the "Ready for Review" column. No more wondering what you need to respond to.

**Track Progress in Real Time** Watch features move from conception to completion. You'll always know where things stand without having to ask.

**Provide Context-Rich Feedback** Comment directly on the specific feature you're discussing, with the ability to attach screenshots or reference documents.

## Enhanced Communication with Loom

For complex features or when visual explanation is needed, we use Loom screen recordings to provide clear, detailed communication.

### When We Use Loom

-   **Feature demonstrations** - Show you exactly how new functionality works
-   **Feedback requests** - Walk through what we've built and ask specific questions
-   **Problem explanation** - Visual explanation of technical issues or constraints
-   **Design reviews** - Guide you through design decisions and options
-   **Training content** - Show you how to use new admin features

### Loom Benefits

**Quick to Create** Instead of writing long explanations, we can record a 2-minute screen capture that shows exactly what we mean.

**Easy to Consume** You can watch at your own pace, pause to take notes, or re-watch sections as needed.

**Reduces Miscommunication** Visual demonstration eliminates ambiguity about what we're discussing.

**Permanent Reference** All Loom videos are saved in the relevant Trello cards for future reference.

## Development Workflow Integration

### Feature Development Cycle

1. **Feature Planning** - Requirements discussed and clarified in Trello card comments
2. **Development** - Card moves to "Doing" with regular updates
3. **Internal Testing** - We verify functionality works as expected
4. **Client Review** - Card moves to "Ready for Review" column, often with Loom demo
5. **Feedback Integration** - Your comments guide any needed revisions
6. **Completion** - Approved features move to "Done" column

### Continuous Visibility

You'll have 24/7 access to:

-   Current project status
-   What's being worked on right now
-   What needs your attention
-   Complete project history and decisions
-   All project files and communications

### Team Collaboration

If multiple people from Tri-State need to be involved:

-   Everyone can be added to relevant cards
-   Notifications ensure the right people see updates
-   Different team members can handle different types of feedback
-   All context is preserved for everyone to see

_This transparent, organized approach ensures that the Tri-State website project runs smoothly with clear communication and no surprises. You'll always know what's happening and have easy ways to provide the feedback needed to keep things moving forward._
