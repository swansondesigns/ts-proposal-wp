# Design Process

## Collaborative Design Workflow

Our design process ensures that Tri-State's website perfectly captures your brand while meeting all functional requirements. This collaborative approach keeps you involved throughout the design phase while maintaining professional workflow standards.

### Discovery and Planning

The design process begins with understanding your organization:

-   **Brand audit** - Review existing brand materials and guidelines
-   **Stakeholder interviews** - Understand goals and preferences from key team members
-   **Content planning** - Identify key pages and content types that need custom design treatment
-   **Technical requirements** - Understand any design constraints or special functionality needs

### Homepage Design Development

We begin with Tri-State's homepage, creating initial concepts that capture your organization's personality and goals:

-   **Initial concept development** - Create 2-3 distinct homepage approaches for review
-   **Stakeholder presentation** - Present concepts with explanation of design rationale
-   **Collaborative revision process** - Work with the marketing team to refine the chosen direction
-   **Design refinement** - Iterate until the homepage perfectly represents the Tri-State brand
-   **Final approval** - Secure sign-off before extending to other pages

### Design System Extension

Once the homepage is approved, we'll extend that design language throughout the site:

-   **Template development** - Create designs for all key page types
-   **Component standardization** - Establish reusable design elements
-   **Design consistency review** - Ensure cohesive experience across all pages
-   **Mobile optimization** - Adapt all designs for optimal mobile experience
-   **Stakeholder review cycles** - Regular check-ins to maintain alignment

### Design Documentation

Throughout the process, we document all design decisions:

-   **Style guide creation** - Document colors, typography, spacing, and usage guidelines
-   **Component library** - Catalog reusable design elements for future reference
-   **Design rationale** - Explain reasoning behind major design decisions
-   **Brand integration notes** - Document how existing brand elements are incorporated
-   **Future expansion guidelines** - Provide direction for maintaining design consistency in future updates
