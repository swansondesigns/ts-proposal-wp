# Ongoing Costs

## Understanding Long-Term Costs

While WordPress itself is free, there are some ongoing costs associated with maintaining a professional website.

### WP Engine Hosting Costs

Tri-State will host with WP Engine, the leading managed WordPress hosting provider. WP Engine hosting is billed directly to your organization based on the plan selected.

#### Baseline Hosting Plan

**Startup Plan - $30/month** ($25/month when paid annually)

-   1 website
-   25,000 monthly visits
-   10 GB storage
-   75 GB bandwidth per month
-   3 environments (production, staging, development)
-   Includes: automated backups, SSL certificates, CDN, 24/7 support

#### Available Add-Ons

WP Engine offers optional add-ons that can be added to the Startup plan as needed:

-   **Automated Plugin Updates**: $3/month - Keeps all plugins current automatically
-   **Enhanced Security**: $19/month - Advanced threat protection and monitoring
-   **Traffic Overages**: $1 per 1,000 additional monthly visits beyond the 25,000 limit
-   **Storage Add-Ons**: $5/month per additional 5 GB beyond the 10 GB included

#### Recommended Configuration

For a professional website like Tri-State's, we recommend the following configuration at **$57/month** total:

-   **Startup Plan** (annual billing): $25/month
-   **Automated Plugin Updates**: $3/month
-   **Enhanced Security**: $19/month
-   **Additional Storage** (10 GB): $10/month

**Total Annual Hosting Cost**: $684/year

### Developer License Benefits

As part of working with us, Tri-State benefits from our existing developer licenses for premium plugins that will be part of your website. This represents a small cost savings but, more importantly, removes the requirement to manage accounts and renewals yourself.

**Included at No Additional Cost:**

-   **Gravity Forms Pro** - Professional form management system (normally $259/year)
-   **Advanced Custom Fields Pro** - Enhanced content management capabilities (normally $100/year)
-   **WP Migrate** - Professional site migration and deployment tools (normally $149/year)
-   **WP All Import/Export Pro** - Advanced data import and export functionality (normally $199/year)

**Total Annual Savings**: $700+ in premium plugin licenses

These developer licenses allow us to provide enterprise-level functionality while keeping your ongoing costs minimal. You benefit from professional tools without the individual license fees.

### Additional Third-Party Plugin Considerations

While most functionality is covered by our developer licenses, there may occasionally be specialized plugins specific to your industry or unique requirements:

-   Costs typically range from $30-100 per plugin per year
-   Licenses usually include updates and support
-   We'll discuss any additional plugins with you before purchase
-   Initial purchase is not included in the project cost
-   Plugin purchase and renewal can be managed by us and charged back if desired
