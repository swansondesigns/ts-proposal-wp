# Discussion Topics

The following questions and topics have been identified throughout the proposal for discussion and clarification.

## Section 2: Client Requirements

### Content Builder

**Workflow and Publishing**: How should content creation, review, and publishing workflows be structured? This relates to the flexible page building system and whether you need approval processes, multiple user roles for content creation, or automated publishing workflows.

### Blogs

**Cross-referencing capabilities**: Would you like the ability to link related content across different channels? For example, linking a blog post about energy efficiency to a related resource article about battery storage, or connecting a news announcement to a follow-up feature interview?

**Author Profiles**: What level of author information do you need for blog posts? Are you looking for simple categorization by author name and title, or do you need more robust author pages with bios, photos, contact information, and the ability to view all posts by a specific author? This affects whether we implement basic byline functionality or create a full author management system with dedicated profile pages.

### Search Functionality

**Search Requirements**: The current Tri-State website has a search feature that may not be meeting your needs effectively. Do you need search functionality on the new site, and if so, what should visitors typically be searching for? Are they looking for specific documents like annual reports or SEC filings, news articles about particular topics, or contact information and services? Understanding the actual use cases will help determine whether a robust search system is worth the investment or if better navigation and content organization might solve the problem more effectively.

### Content Reusability

**Reusable Content Systems**: Do you need the ability to create content once and use it in multiple places? For example, testimonials that appear on homepage, service pages, and dedicated testimonials page, or team member information that displays on About page, blog post bylines, and contact sections. This reduces maintenance work and ensures consistency, but adds complexity if most content is unique to each page.

### Content Migration

**Migration Scope**: What content from the existing website needs to be moved to the new site? Should this be a complete transfer of all existing content or a selective migration of only current, relevant materials? Who will be responsible for the migration work - your team copying content or should we include migration services in the project scope?

### Workflow Features

**Publishing Capabilities**: Which workflow and publishing features would be valuable for your team? Options include preview capabilities for seeing changes before publishing, enhanced revision history with detailed change tracking, scheduled publishing for time-sensitive content like earnings releases, draft and review workflows for content approval processes, and content duplication for creating similar pages quickly.

## Section 3: Deliverables

### User Access

**Account Expiration**: Should temporary external accounts automatically expire after a set period, or would you prefer manual account management?

**Form Management Role**: Would you like a dedicated user role specifically for form management with access only to form creation and submission viewing?

## Section 7: Modern Website Essentials

### Analytics & Tracking

**Additional Analytics Requirements**: Are there any other analytics, tracking, or measurement tools that need to be integrated into the website beyond Google Tag Manager?
