# Project Exclusions

## What's Not Included

To ensure clear expectations, this section outlines what is not included in the standard project scope.

### Content Creation

We build the systems for managing content, but do not create content itself:

- Writing blog posts or articles
- Creating marketing copy
- Developing content strategy
- Photography or video production
- Content migration beyond initial setup assistance

You are responsible for providing all content, though we'll guide you on requirements and best practices.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

While we build sites that are search-engine friendly, we don't provide ongoing SEO services:

- **Included**: Technical SEO foundation, clean code, proper structure
- **Not Included**: Keyword research, content optimization, link building, ongoing SEO campaigns

Your site will be built to be easily indexed by search engines, but achieving specific rankings requires ongoing content and SEO work beyond our scope.

### Browser Support

We support all modern browsers but do not guarantee functionality in outdated browsers:

- **Supported**: Current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Limited Support**: Browsers more than 2 versions old
- **Not Supported**: Internet Explorer (Microsoft ended support in 2022)

Sites will gracefully degrade in older browsers but may not have all features available.

### Third-Party Systems

We integrate with systems you specify, but don't provide or support the third-party systems themselves:

- Email marketing platforms (though we'll integrate with them)
- CRM systems
- Payment processors
- External databases
- Third-party APIs beyond initial integration

### Ongoing Updates

After launch, certain updates are your responsibility:

- Content updates and additions
- WordPress core updates (unless hosting with us)
- Plugin updates (unless hosting with us)
- Security monitoring (unless hosting with us)

### Legal and Compliance

While we build features to help with compliance, we don't provide:

- Legal advice
- Compliance consulting
- Privacy policy or terms of service drafting
- Accessibility certification
- Industry-specific compliance validation

### Performance Guarantees

We optimize for performance but cannot guarantee specific metrics that depend on factors outside our control:

- Specific page load times (depends on hosting, content, traffic)
- Uptime guarantees (depends on hosting provider)
- Traffic handling (depends on hosting infrastructure)

### Training Scope

Training covers using the website we build, not general topics:

- **Included**: How to use your specific website features
- **Not Included**: General WordPress training, HTML/CSS training, marketing training

### Disaster Recovery

Unless hosting with us:

- Backup strategy and implementation
- Disaster recovery planning
- Data restoration services
- Emergency response

These exclusions help maintain project focus and control costs. Any of these services can be added to your project as separate engagements if needed.
