# Full Development Freedom

## Breaking Free from Platform Limitations

Tri-State currently operates under a website-as-a-service model that creates significant limitations for your digital strategy. You need the flexibility to adapt and grow your online presence without being constrained by platform restrictions.

### Current Limitations

Website-as-a-service platforms impose restrictions that limit your options:

-   **Feature limitations** — You can only use what the platform provides
-   **Design constraints** — Templates and customization options are limited
-   **Integration barriers** — Connecting with your existing tools may not be possible
-   **Performance restrictions** — You can't optimize beyond what the platform allows
-   **Vendor dependency** — Your website's future is tied to one company's decisions

### Need for Flexibility

As a generation and transmission organization, your digital needs are unique and evolving:

-   **Custom functionality** — Features specific to utility companies and cooperatives
-   **Integration requirements** — Seamless connection with Salesforce, Mailchimp, and other business tools
-   **Compliance needs** — SEC requirements and regulatory standards that change over time
-   **Future growth** — Ability to add new features as your digital strategy evolves
-   **Independence** — Freedom to make changes without vendor approval or limitations
