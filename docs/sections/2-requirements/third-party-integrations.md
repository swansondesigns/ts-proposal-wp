# Third Party Integrations

## External System Connections

Tri-State requires integration with external business systems to streamline operations and maintain data consistency across platforms.

### Salesforce Integration

Tri-State uses Salesforce as a key business system. The website needs to integrate with Salesforce, though the specific nature and scope of this integration requires further discussion.

Potential integration points may include:

- Form submissions syncing to Salesforce
- Lead capture and tracking
- Contact information synchronization
- Data display from Salesforce records
- Event registration management

The exact requirements, data flow, and integration approach will be determined during the discovery phase of the project.

### Other Integrations

*Additional third-party integrations will be identified during the discovery phase.*
