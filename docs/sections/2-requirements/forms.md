# Forms

## Form Management Requirements

Tri-State needs to be able to create and modify forms without developer assistance for routine needs. This includes:

### Form Building Capabilities

-   Adding or removing fields with drag-and-drop interface
-   Multiple field types: text, email, phone, dropdown, checkbox, radio buttons, file uploads
-   Updating field labels and help text
-   Setting field validation rules and required field settings
-   Creating multi-page forms with progress indicators
-   Conditional logic to show/hide fields based on user selections

### Administrative Controls

-   Form scheduling (open/close dates)
-   Form duplication and template creation
-   Entry management and export capabilities
-   Entry filtering and searching

### Confirmation Management

-   Customizable confirmation/thank you pages
-   Personalized confirmation messages based on form selections
-   Redirect options after form submission

### Notification Management (Email)

-   Automatic email notifications to administrators
-   Customizable email templates for notifications
-   Multiple notification recipients based on form selections
-   User confirmation emails with custom messaging

### Email Delivery Services

To ensure reliable email delivery from forms, the website will be connected to a professional email delivery service. This ensures that email notifications are delivered consistently and avoid common issues like emails going to spam folders or being blocked by email providers. These services provide better delivery rates, detailed reporting on email delivery status, and professional sender reputation management.

### User Experience

Forms should be easy to complete with clear labels and helpful error messages, logical field order and grouping, mobile-friendly input methods, accessibility for users with disabilities, and progress indicators for multi-step forms when needed.

## Questions

**Salesforce Integration**: Do you need forms to integrate with Salesforce? Will forms be created in Salesforce and added to the website or will forms that are created on the website push submission data into Salesforce?

_Specific form requirements and integration needs will be finalized during the discovery phase of the project._
