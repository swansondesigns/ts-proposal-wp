# Content Builder

Your website needs a system that provides **structure** for everyday content creation while remaining **flexible** enough to handle special requirements, all without compromising the **integrity of the overall system**.

## Flexible Page-Building System

The marketing team needs the ability to create diverse page layouts using a variety of content blocks and design elements. Pages across the Tri-State site will use different combinations of content types and layouts. The goal is flexibility with consistencyâ€”allowing unique page designs while maintaining brand standards and cohesive design throughout the site.

## One-Off and Special Content

Beyond standard page templates and content blocks, Tri-State occasionally needs to create unique content presentations for special initiatives or campaigns. These one-off needs might include:

-   Special landing pages for campaigns
-   Unique layouts for annual reports
-   Specialized content that doesn't fit standard templates
