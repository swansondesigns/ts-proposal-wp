## Western Watts Podcast Platform

Tri-State's Western Watts podcast requires its own dedicated platform within the website, distinct from other content channels.

### Podcast Homepage

A dedicated landing page for Western Watts that showcases:

-   Latest episodes prominently displayed
-   About the podcast information
-   Host bios
-   Episode archive with search and filtering
-   Links to show page for various podcast platforms

### Episode Pages

The podcast needs a comprehensive system for managing episodes including:

-   Individual episode pages with Transistor audio players
-   Show notes and episode descriptions
-   Guest information and bios

?>The **Transistor player** handles sharing and subscription features.

### Content Integration

While distinct from blogs, the podcast should integrate with the broader website:

-   Cross-promotion with related blog content
-   Inclusion in site-wide search results
-   Connection to relevant resource materials
