# Client Requirements

This section focuses purely on identifying Tri-State's website needs - the "what" without the "how." By clearly defining each requirement first, we can ensure every business need is understood before discussing technical solutions.

Each requirement listed here will have a corresponding solution detailed in the Deliverables section.
