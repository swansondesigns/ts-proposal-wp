# Document Management

## Regulatory and Document Requirements

Tri-State has specific requirements for document management driven by regulatory compliance and stakeholder communication needs.

### SEC Compliance - Proof of Posting

As a regulated entity, Tri-State must comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for timely posting of certain documents. The requirements include:

- **Verifiable Posting** - A system that proves when documents were posted to your website
- **Timestamp Documentation** - Clear, auditable records of publication dates and times
- **Version Control** - Tracking document updates and maintaining historical versions
- **Compliance Reporting** - The ability to generate reports demonstrating compliance with posting requirements

Currently, Tri-State has no reliable way to prove compliance with these regulatory requirements. The marketing team needs a system that creates an indisputable record of when materials were made publicly available.
