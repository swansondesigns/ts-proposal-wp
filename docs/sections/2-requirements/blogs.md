## Multiple Publication Channels

Tri-State requires several distinct publication channels, each serving different purposes and audiences within the energy cooperative community.

### Blog

Member education content featuring practical energy efficiency tips, seasonal home comfort advice, and cost-saving strategies for rural communities. Articles focus on actionable guidance for reducing energy costs and improving home comfort throughout the year.

### News

Official press releases and corporate communications about significant business developments, regulatory matters, and strategic initiatives. This formal communication channel delivers timely announcements about operational changes, financial updates, regulatory compliance, and major business decisions that affect stakeholders and the broader energy industry.

### Features

Employee spotlight articles and executive interviews featuring Tri-State staff members. Content includes "The People Behind the Power" series profiling employees across different departments and Q&A sessions with senior leadership discussing operations, strategy, and industry perspectives.

### Resources

Industry-focused articles covering major infrastructure projects, policy developments, and organizational initiatives. Content includes detailed coverage of energy storage projects, wildfire mitigation programs, federal funding opportunities, and strategic partnerships within the energy sector.

### Newsletter Archive

Historical member newsletters and email communications need to remain accessible and searchable. This maintains continuity for long-term members and creates a comprehensive resource of past energy tips, programs, and cooperative updates.

### Channel Management

Each of these channels needs:

-   Its own identity while maintaining overall brand consistency
-   Independent browsing and archive pages
-   Clear labeling so visitors understand what type of content they're viewing
-   Appropriate categorization and tagging within each channel

The system must make it easy for the marketing team to manage multiple content streams without confusion, while presenting a unified experience to website visitors.
