# SSL Certificate

All modern websites should be encrypted. To encrypt traffic, the site needs an SSL certificate. The cost for a certificate can range from free to thousands of dollars. Many hosting companies have started including an SSL certificate as part of even basic hosting packages. The right SSL certificate varies from site to site, but for most websites, a free certificate is just fine.

**NOTE:** A paid SSL certificate does not provide "stronger" encryption than a free certificate. There are several reasons that a paid certificate costs money. They are not a scam, but a website needs to have very specific business needs in order for those costs to be justified.
