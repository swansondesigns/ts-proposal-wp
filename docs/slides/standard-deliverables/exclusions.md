# Exclusions

## Search Engine Optimization

All websites should be easily read and indexed by a search engine. To do this, the internal structure of the website needs to conform to a specific set of criteria set out by search engines. This website will conform to those standards. This is the heart of Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

However, many people use SEO to mean the intentional adjustment of website content to increase the ranking of a website on search engine results pages (SERPs). This is something that is largely out of the realm of control of the website developer. So, while the site will be built to be easily indexed by search engines, there is no guarantee made of any specific search engine ranking.

## Support for Outdated Browsers

This exclusion scares a lot of people because it feels like an escape clause where we don't have to address browser-specific bugs. That is not the case. This exclusion is almost exclusively for Internet Explorer. Microsoft itself stopped supporting IE 10 in 2016.

The primary reason for this exclusion is because building websites that maintain backwards compatibility limits the options available. In short, you can't make something very good if it has to work with outdated technology.

## Content Updates

Content updates will be made by the client unless a separate arrangement is created to cover this service.

## SSL Certificate

All modern websites should be encrypted. To encrypt traffic, the site needs an SSL certificate. The cost for a certificate can range from free to thousands of dollars. Many hosting companies have started including an SSL certificate as part of even basic hosting packages. The right SSL certificate varies from site to site, but for most websites, a free certificate is just fine.

**NOTE:** A paid SSL certificate does not provide "stronger" encryption than a free certificate. There are several reasons that a paid certificate costs money. They are not a scam, but a website needs to have very specific business needs in order for those costs to be justified.
