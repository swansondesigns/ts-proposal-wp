# Support for Outdated Browsers

This exclusion scares a lot of people because it feels like an escape clause where we don't have to address browser-specific bugs. That is not the case. This exclusion is almost exclusively for Internet Explorer. Microsoft itself stopped supporting IE 10 in 2016.

The primary reason for this exclusion is because building websites that maintain backwards compatibility limits the options available. In short, you can't make something very good if it has to work with outdated technology.
