# Search Engine Optimization

All websites should be easily read and indexed by a search engine. To do this, the internal structure of the website needs to conform to a specific set of criteria set out by search engines. This website will conform to those standards. This is the heart of Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

However, many people use SEO to mean the intentional adjustment of website content to increase the ranking of a website on search engine results pages (SERPs). This is something that is largely out of the realm of control of the website developer. So, while the site will be built to be easily indexed by search engines, there is no guarantee made of any specific search engine ranking.
