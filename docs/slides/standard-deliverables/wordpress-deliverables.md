# WordPress Deliverables

## Documentation
Documentation for this project will be included for custom features. Any feature that is part of the default behavior for WordPress will not be included. Creating documentation for existing features would inflate the price and comprehensive documentation is already available.

## Deployment
The final step with any website is to take it live. In general, this is a fairly straightforward process, but it often involves communication between the client and the developer. Part of the deliverable will be reasonable assistance, instructions, and support to take the website live.

## Features
This website does not include any custom features.
