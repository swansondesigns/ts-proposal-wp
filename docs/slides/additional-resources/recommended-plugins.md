## Important Notes

### Plugin Philosophy

We believe in using plugins strategically rather than extensively. Our approach prioritizes:

- **Core WordPress Features First**: Leveraging built-in WordPress functionality when possible
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Fewer, well-chosen plugins rather than many specialized ones
- **Performance Consideration**: Each plugin addition is weighed against its impact on site speed
- **Long-term Viability**: Selecting plugins with strong development teams and user bases

### Custom Development Alternative

For some functionality needs, custom development may be more appropriate than plugins. We'll advise when a custom solution would be:

- More cost-effective long-term
- Better for performance
- More aligned with your specific requirements
- Easier to maintain and update
