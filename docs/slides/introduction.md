# Introduction

## Project Description

This project will include the creation of a new layout and design for the website. Initial discussions will guide the design process to make sure that the design incorporates the look and feel of the organization while enhancing usability.

### Design Process

To start, we will design the home page. This proposal includes a single concept, with two variations. The client may select one variation and provide design feedback through two rounds of revisions.

Once the home page is designed, we will comp all of the other key pages so that you know exactly what they will look like. This design phase includes one round of revisions, and all feedback should be sent as a single unit to ensure that the design feels like a unified whole.

### Website Development

The website will be built on WordPress using a custom-built theme. All pre-built features of WordPress will be included unless otherwise specified. Major features that are not part of WordPress are listed in the "Features" section below.

All pages will be mobile-friendly, meaning that the pages can be viewed easily on any device. The layout of the page will change based on the width of the device. All hover-based navigation is removed on mobile devices and is replaced with a touch-based interface.
