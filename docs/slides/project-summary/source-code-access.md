# Source Code Access

## Current Challenge
Your website is currently on a hosted platform, which means any customizations must be requested through the hosting company rather than implemented directly.

## Key Limitations:
- **No Direct Code Access** - Cannot modify source code or add custom functionality
- **Limited Control** - Restricted to pre-approved themes and basic customizations
- **Request-Based Changes** - Must submit requests and wait for hosting provider approval
- **Feature Constraints** - Cannot implement unique business requirements or integrations

## Impact:
This creates dependency on third-party approval, longer implementation times, and restrictions on achieving your specific business goals.
