# Ongoing Costs

## Plugins

In many cases, the most reliable and cost-effective way to create a website feature is to use a commercially available plugin. These plugins are small pieces of software and are created by software companies. Most of these companies offer ongoing support and updates for their plugins for one year as part of the purchase price. After one year, the plugin will continue to work as it always did, but it will no longer receive updates, and access to support from the software company will be limited or unavailable. To continue receiving support and updates from the software company, they sell annual support plans that range from 30% to 100% of the purchase price (purchase price is normally $30-$70). These support plans are optional. However, for business-critical features of the website, it may be worth the money to pay for the support plan. The decision to buy a support plan can be made on a case-by-case basis.

All decisions about whether to use a commercially available plugin and the options/cost associated will be cleared with the client before purchase.

**NOTE:** The initial cost of any plugins is included in the price of the proposal.

## Hosting

Hosting is available for $50/month and includes on-site and off-site backups, plugin updates as well as disaster recovery services. Please note that not all plugins should be updated whenever there is an update available, so this process is not automated. Website admins may see plugins with updates available from time to time.

You do not have to host your website with me to have me build your website. I host websites for my clients as a way to provide a more comprehensive offering. I do not host websites that I did not build.
